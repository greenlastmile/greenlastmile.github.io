# Job description

**Job title**: Research Associate/Assistant (PhD/postdoc level) 

**Location**: Copenhagen, Boston, London or remote

**Duration**: 9-12 months full-time

**Salary:** The salary is competitive and in accordance with the experience of the candidate and the criteria of the lead institution

**Level**: 

This is an exciting opportunity for an early career researcher, having completed or currently pursuing a PhD in a field related to deep learning, data science, statistics or mathematical optimization. This position can also be tailored as a long-term PhD internship, or be integrated in a PhD project. Our funding will allow compensation up to the postdoc level. 

Given the uniqueness of the project, we are open for applications from **motivated MSc students (US: undergraduate seniors)** who are looking to gain research experience, with the potential for high impact publications, before joining a PhD program.

### Opportunity of the job

We are seeking a research associate for a fixed-term period of 6-9 months. The position is expected to start from May 2022. 

The research position is supported by a [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) Innovation Grant that aims to leverage machine learning for environmental impact.  

The research will be in collaboration with academics at ITU (Copenhagen, Denmark) and MIT/IBM Research (Cambridge, MA, US), as well as an industry partner based in London, working at the intersection of machine learning and urban logistics.

The supervisors for this project are [Dr Maria Astefanoaei](https://mariaast.github.io/) (ITU), [Dr Akash Srivastava](http://akashgit.github.io/) (MIT/IBM Research) and [Dr Kai Xu](https://xuk.ai/) (Edinburgh University). The industry partner is [Kale Collective](https://kalecollective.co.uk/), a London-based start-up, and its network of cargo bike logistics partners. 

### Project aims

Cargo bike logistics has been put forward as a competitive, zero-emission candidate for replacing delivery vans in urban areas. Experts estimate well over 1/4 of van deliveries could be replaced by cargo bikes. Due to their faster speeds, shorter parking times and more efficient routes across cities, they can out-compete traditional van logistics when operated effectively [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516000478),[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357528729_Delivering_Paris_by_Cargo_Bikes_Ecological_Commitment_or_Economically_Feasible_The_Case_of_a_Parcel_Service_Company_-_TRB_2022),[3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30896202a18c0001b49180/t/61091edc3acfda2f4af7d97f/1627987694676/The+Promise+of+Low-Carbon+Freight.pdf)].

Despite these competitive advantages in dense urban areas, their widespread adoption by logistics operators is limited. This is primarily due to the lack of inexpensive ways of accurately evaluating their impact on the cost of business.

To this end, the project aims to develop data-driven tools to allow for accurate models of hybrid (vans+cargo-bikes) fleet operation under real-world settings. This framework will enable key stakeholders to run feasibility studies towards optimizing and diversifying their fleet composition.

### Your skills and attributes for success

- High proficiency in a scientific programming language (Python and/or Julia/R).

**Experience in at least one of the following:**

- deep learning, machine learning or mathematical optimization
- Urban data science, mobility data, open street map (OSM), street networks
- scientific/computational modelling of behavior, or complex systems

**Desirable skills, but not required**

- Experience with the implementation of deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Research experience in one of the following:
    - topics at the intersection of deep learning and combinatorial optimization
    - machine learning topics related to representation learning, graph neural network, structured data.
    - problems related to urban mobility or Operations Research (OR)

### As a part of this project, you can expect

An exciting project at the intersection of academia and industry. As part of this project, you will apply machine learning methods to new problems in the domain of logistics and urban mobility.

Help layout the ground for future research focusing on the application of machine learning for climate change impact. The work you will lead is likely to have a direct impact on the quality of life in cities.
