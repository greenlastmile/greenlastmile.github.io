# Open Jobs

## Postdoctoral Researcher / Research Associate

**Location**: Copenhagen, Boston, London or remote

**Duration**: 9-12 months full-time

**Level**:  PhD level, or postdoc

### Opportunity of the job

We are seeking a postdoc/research associate for a fixed-term period of 6-9 months. The position is expected to start from April 2022. 

This is an exciting opportunity for an early career researcher, having completed or currently pursuing a PhD in a field related to deep learning, machine learning, mathematical optimisation or data science.

The research position is supported by a [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) Innovation Grant that aims to leverage machine learning for environmental impact.  

The research will be in collaboration with academics at ITU (Copenhagen, Denmark) and MIT/IBM Research (Cambridge, MA, US), as well as an industry partner based in London, working at the intersection of machine learning and urban logistics.

The supervisors for this project are Dr Maria Astefanoaei (ITU), Dr Akash Srivastava (MIT/IBM Research) and Dr Kai Xu (Edinburgh University). The industry partner is [Kale Collective](https://kalecollective.co.uk/), a London-based start-up, and its network of cargo bike logistics partners. 

### Project aims

Cargo bike logistics has been put forward as a competitive, zero-emission candidate for replacing delivery vans in urban areas. Experts estimate well over 1/4 of van deliveries could be replaced by cargo bikes. Due to their faster speeds, shorter parking times and more efficient routes across cities, they can out-compete traditional van logistics when operated effectively [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516000478),[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357528729_Delivering_Paris_by_Cargo_Bikes_Ecological_Commitment_or_Economically_Feasible_The_Case_of_a_Parcel_Service_Company_-_TRB_2022),[3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30896202a18c0001b49180/t/61091edc3acfda2f4af7d97f/1627987694676/The+Promise+of+Low-Carbon+Freight.pdf)].

Despite these competitive advantages in dense urban areas, their widespread adoption by logistics operators is limited. This is primarily due to the lack of inexpensive ways of accurately evaluating their impact on the cost of business.

To this end, the project aims to develop data-driven tools to allow for accurate models of hybrid (vans+cargo-bikes) fleet operation under real-world settings. This framework will enable key stakeholders to run feasibility studies towards optimising and diversifying their fleet composition in a cost-effective manner.

### Your skills and attributes for success

- Master's degree or in the process of pursuing a PhD in deep learning, machine learning and mathematical optimisation.
- Extensive experience with the implementation of deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Familiarity with Python and/or Julia/R.

### Desirable skills, but not required

- PhD in topics at the intersection of deep learning and combinatorial optimisation or PhD in machine learning topics related to representation learning, graph neural network, structured data.
- Experience in problems related to (urban) logistics or Operations Research (OR)
- Experience working with GPS mobility data, open street map (OSM), street networks

### As a part of this project, you can expect

An exciting project at the intersection of academia and industry. As part of this project, you will apply machine learning methods to new problems in the domain of logistics and urban mobility.

Help layout the ground for future research focusing on the application of machine learning for climate change impact. The work you will lead is likely to have a direct impact on the quality of life in cities.
